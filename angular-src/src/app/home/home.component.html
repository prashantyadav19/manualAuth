        <h1>Navbar example</h1>
        <p>This example is a quick exercise to illustrate how the default, static and fixed to top navbar work. It includes the responsive CSS and HTML, so it also adapts to your viewport and device.</p>
        <p>To see the difference between static and fixed top navbars, just scroll.</p>
        <p>
            <a [routerLink]="['/register']" class="btn btn-primary">Register</a>
            <a [routerLink]="['/login']" class="btn btn-success">Login</a>
        </p>
